I am a researcher at the French National Center for Scientific Research (<a href="http://www.cnrs.fr/index.html">CNRS</a>), working in the areas of multilingual computational semantics and translation. My interests include data-driven semantic analysis, paraphrasing, text simplification and cross-lingual knowledge transfer. My research addresses both theoretical and application-oriented aspects of semantics. It ranges from explorations on the nature of automatically acquired meaning representations and their adequacy for automatic processing, to the integration of semantic models in NLP applications and automatic evaluation metrics, aiming to improve their performance and increase their correlation with human quality judgments.
